                  <p><em>Our song "PTSD" will be available as a free download in hopes that you share it with those who need to hear it. I don't expect the song the save the world- but the Vet who told me to write it said there are a lot of people who need to know they're not alone.</em></p>
                  <p><em>The rest of the album has plenty of songs about girls, love, career choices, anxiety, divorce, and infatuation. This one took a long time. I hope you find time to give it an ear👂🤘&rdquo;</em><br /><strong> - Nick Britt</strong></p>

                  <h3>November 28th, 2015 &ldquo;PTSD&rdquo; selected as this weeks Buzz Cut on 102.9</h3>
                  <p><em>&ldquo;<strong>I am beyond honored to have our song &ldquo;PTSD&rdquo; selected as this weeks Buzz Cut on 102.9.</strong><br> (Meaning you can hear it everyday this week at 2pm)</em></p>
                  <p><em><strong>It's a song that's very dear and serious to me because it was inspired by the struggles of our soldiers who return from battle, only to go to war with themselves.</strong> My brother in law, who was a combat medic in Iraq and Afghanistan, lost one of his best friends when an IED tore through his Humvee, inflicting fatal wounds and creating emotional trauma in the rest of the company that may never subside. And though the war is &ldquo;over&rdquo;, there continues to be a record number of suicides by our servicemen that needs to be addressed. They claw through hell, and when they get home we expect them to &ldquo;dust it off and carry on.&rdquo;</em></p>
                  <p><em><strong>The song is bigger than I am because it's all I have to offer as a token of appreciation for their service. </strong>I'm overjoyed that 102.9 the buzz has gotten behind this tune to push it. If you get a chance, turn it up.</em></p>
                  <p><em><strong>And thank a Vet&hellip;</strong>&rdquo;</em><br><strong>- Nick Britt</strong></p>
