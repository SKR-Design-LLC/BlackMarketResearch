The song &ldquo;<strong>Insult to Injury&quot;</strong> caught the attention of Grammy&mdash;winning producer Adrian David Payne, who gave the band their first music video.</p>

    <p>In 2012, the band released their sophomore project &ldquo;<strong>Shapeshifter's Masquerade</strong>&rdquo;, which was nominated by Nashville Industry Music Awards for Album of the Year. BMR was also nominated for Best Live Rock Performers, Best Pop Rock Band and Artist of the Year.</p>

    <p>In 2015, BMR successfully funded a Kickstarter campaign and began production of their third studio effort called &ldquo;<strong>Nobody Fits</strong>&rdquo;, produced by Grammy Award winner,<strong> Chad Brown</strong>. The band was joined by heavy hitters such as guitarist <strong>Doug Lancio</strong> (John Hyatt, Hootie and the Blowfish, Patty Griffin), guitarist <strong>Slim Gambill</strong> (Lady Antebellum), keyboardist <strong>Arlan Oscar</strong>, and percussionist <strong>Matthew Burgess</strong>.
